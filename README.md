# Pulsy

Pulsy is a platform for easy development, deployment, and management of real-time, enriched, trustless blockchain data feeds â€” **with full cross-chain support**.

We enable developers and teams to create custom real-time blockchain data pipelines with minimal setup, providing streamed access to decoded and context-rich on-chain events. Pulsy supports multiple blockchains out of the box and delivers feeds via PostgreSQL, Webhooks, S3, or WebSockets for seamless integration into any backend, analytics stack, or automated workflow.
